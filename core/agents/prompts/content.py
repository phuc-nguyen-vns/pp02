                Given the following information:

                📚 Policy Context:
                {context}

                💬 Prior Conversation History:
                {history_text}

                📝 Please answer the current user question based on the provided policy context and conversation history.

                📦 Return your response strictly as a **valid JSON** object using this exact format:

                {{
                    "answer": "<Provide a well-structured response here. Use bullet points (•) or numbered steps for clarity. Escape line breaks correctly as '\\n' (two characters) inside the JSON string, not as real line breaks.>",

                }}

                ✅ Guidelines for the "answer" field:
                - Do **NOT** output actual line breaks. Use exactly `\\n` to indicate a new line.
                - If including quotes inside the answer, escape them properly as `\\"`.
                - Use bullet points (•) or numbered steps if listing multiple elements.
                - Keep the language formal and aligned with official policy tone.
                - If the answer is unavailable in the provided context, respond using your general knowledge to give the most accurate and helpful answer possible.


                📚 Guidelines for the "source" field:
                - Only include documents and locations that directly support the answer.
                - If no sources were used, return an empty list: "source": []

                ❗ Final Output Instructions:
                - Ensure the output is **machine-readable valid JSON**.
                - Do not add any additional commentary outside the JSON block.
